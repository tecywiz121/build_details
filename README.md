## Introduction

`build_details` is a code generation helper that provides build information
at runtime.

There are two steps to adding `build_details` to a crate:

 * Adding/modifying `build.rs`; and
 * Including the generated file.

## Getting Started

### Invoking Build Details

Invoking `build_details` is as simple as adding the following snippet to
`build.rs`:

```rust
extern crate build_details;

fn main() {
    build_details::BuildDetails::default()
        .generate("build_details.rs")
        .unwrap();
}
```

### Including Generated File

In `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
pub mod build_details {
    include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/build_details.rs"));
}
```

### A note on `BuildDetail::Cfg`

Using `BuildDetail::Cfg` requires a runtime dependency on `phf`.

In `Cargo.toml`, add:

```toml
[dependencies]
phf = "0.7"
```

In `src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs`:

```rust
extern crate phf;
```

## Limitations

 * Build timestamp isn't regenerated every build. [Issue #1][i1].
